This simple tic tac toe game was created by following the react official documentation, using functional components instead of class-based components.

All additional challenges were added :

- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

The project settings and files progressing are done with a custom Webpack setup, including babel and Post-CSS.
